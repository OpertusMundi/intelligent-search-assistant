      Yes, the data is all yours. We have an opt-in and opt-out policy without any restrictions. You can always add, remove, or enrich your assets.

      A lot. You can choose from three different options depending on your goals! 
      1. Advertise your assets if you want to gain an EU audience, but do not feel comfortable uploading your assets in our secure data lake. If you go for that option, consumers can find and purchase your asset. You provide assets directly to consumers and after we receive delivery confirmation, transfer the payment to you. 
      2. Sell your assets if you want to gain an international audience, increase your revenues, reduce your admin overhead and improve customer’s satisfaction. With this option, consumers find your asset and purchase it. We deliver the asset and transfer the payment to you immediately. 
      3. Sell your asset as a service if you want to expand your services, increase your revenues, address consumer demand, reduce CAPEX/OPEX and gain a more international audience. In that case the consumers find the service and purchase a license (subscription) and we deliver the service, keep our commission, and bill your account.

      Yes, you are the one that decides. To make it as easy as possible for you, you can select from different pricing modes. In addition, we have predefined contracts that are adjusted to current EU regulations. Chose from them and build your own contract.

      None. We don’t purchase referral fees and do not take commissions. There will be no hidden costs, no advertising costs, and no preferential treatment. There is only the usual standard processing fee for secure electronic payments. We create revenue from our value-added services, not from your assets.
