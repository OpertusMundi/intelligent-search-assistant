      Topio is EUâ€™s first digital marketplace for geospatial data and services.
  utter_ask_what_topio_motto:
  - text: |
      The purpose of Topio is to streamline geospatial data trading across the EU, under fair terms. Geospatial data owners are able to unlock the value of their assets by offering them for sale under their homogenized contracts and licensing terms, while geospatial data users can discover, purchase and use geospatial data assets; all within the Topio platform.
  utter_ask_what_benefit_general_user:
  - text: |
      1. In Topio, you can:
        . Sell data: Trade your geospatial data and services across Europe
        . Buy data: Search, discover and buy geospatial data and services that suit your needs, within seconds.
        . Use data: Store, process, visualize, integrate, and create. From a simple map, to a complex analysis, we are here. 

      2. Topio is more than a marketplace. As a user, you can use the data you buy and data you own right within Topio. Store, process, visualize, integrate, and create. From a simple map, to a complex analysis, we are here. You can store the data you purchase, or data you already own on your personal space in Topio Drive. You can use the data you purchase, or data you already own, to perform complex analytics workflows via the Topio Notebooks. You can also use your data to create beautiful custom maps via Topio Maps.
  utter_ask_what_benefit_data_exchange:
  - text: |
      We only charge you a fee for processing payments â€“ no more. We create revenue from our value-added services, not your success. Our vision is to build a community of geospatial data suppliers and users across the EU, serving our Data Economy.
  utter_ask_easy_trade_data:

  utter_ask_criteria_early_adopter:
  - text: |
      It is first come, first served; continuous onboarding. All suppliers and their data are treated equally and under the same terms. No special favors here.
  utter_ask_data_usage:
  - text: |
      A lot! You can choose from three different options depending on your goals.
        1. Advertise your data if you want to gain an EU audience, but do not feel comfortable uploading your data in our secure data lake. If you go for that option, consumers can find and purchase your data. You provide data directly to consumers and after we receive delivery confirmation, we transfer the payment to you.
        2. Sell your data, increase your revenues, reduce your admin overhead and improve customerâ€™s satisfaction. With this option, consumers find your asset and purchase it. We deliver the asset and transfer the payment to you immediately.
        3. Sell your data as a service if you want to expand your services, increase your revenues, address consumer demand and reduce CAPEX/OPEX. Consumers find the service and purchase a license (subscription) and we deliver the service, keep our commission, and bill your account. 
  utter_ask_become_seller_docs:
  - text: |
      To register as a seller, you need to upload the following documents in order to be KYC/KYB validated for selling assets via Topio:

      Yes, the data is all yours. We have an opt-in and opt-out policy without any restrictions. You can always add, remove, or enrich your assets. 
  utter_ask_sell_asset:
  - text: |
      We donâ€™t receive referral fees and do not take commissions. There are no commissions, no hidden costs, no advertising costs, and no preferential treatment. There is only the usual standard processing fee for secure electronic payments. We create revenue from our value-added services, not from your data.
