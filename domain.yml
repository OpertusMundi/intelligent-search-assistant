  utter_ask_support:
  - text: |
      Yes, we do. If you join as an early user, you get free onboarding for your assets and services. In addition, we also guide you through the marketplace with free trainings for your personnel and do support for your existing clients. You also get free access to early Topio APIs and value-added services. So what are you waiting for?
  utter_ask_early_user:
  - text: |
      It is first come, first served. 
  utter_ask_data_control:
  - text: |
      Yes, the data is all yours. We have an opt-in and opt-out policy without any restrictions. You can always add, remove, or enrich your assets. 
  utter_ask_data_usage:
  - text: |
      A lot. You can choose from three different options depending on your goals! 
      1. Advertise your assets if you want to gain an EU audience, but do not feel comfortable uploading your assets in our secure data lake. If you go for that option, consumers can find and purchase your asset. You provide assets directly to consumers and after we receive delivery confirmation, transfer the payment to you. 
      2. Sell your assets if you want to gain an international audience, increase your revenues, reduce your admin overhead and improve customerâ€™s satisfaction. With this option, consumers find your asset and purchase it. We deliver the asset and transfer the payment to you immediately. 
      3. Sell your asset as a service if you want to expand your services, increase your revenues, address consumer demand, reduce CAPEX/OPEX and gain a more international audience. In that case the consumers find the service and purchase a license (subscription) and we deliver the service, keep our commission, and bill your account. 
  utter_ask_sell_asset:
  - text: |
      None. We donâ€™t purchase referral fees and do not take commissions. There will be no hidden costs, no advertising costs, and no preferential treatment. There is only the usual standard processing fee for secure electronic payments. We create revenue from our value-added services, not from your assets. 
  utter_ask_free_service:
  - text: |
      Sure, you can keep track of all your activity in a Dashboard on one place via a simple to use secure web-based application. You can check rich analytics for your sales across all channels and manage your account, roles in your organization, payment preferences, and much more. Moreover, you can use our Secure Storage to keep track of all your contracts and assets.    
  utter_ask_price_terms:
  - text: |
      Yes, you are the one that decides. To make it as easy as possible for you, you can select from different pricing modes. In addition, we have predefined contracts that are adjusted to current EU regulations. Chose from them and build your own contract. 
  utter_ask_security:
  - text: |
      We do our best nothing goes wrong. Your assets are tracked via our digital watermarks for each unique transaction. Our contracts limit your liability towards clients and protecting you from claims. We are responsible for ensuring the clientâ€™s SLA, not you.    
  utter_ask_terms_and_conditions:
  - text: |
      Sure, here they are the Link to terms. 
  utter_ask_marketplace_functionality:
  - text: |
      You can search for, compare, and purchase geospatial data. We have any type of data, regardless of the domain, size, or type.
  utter_ask_information:
  - text: |
      You can preview key asset information and compare with other assets. 
  utter_ask_data_costs:
  - text: |
      That depends on what you want. You can buy a single file, a collection, or a subscription. Costs are transparently listed in detail in line with each asset. 
  utter_ask_more_than_data:
  - text: |
      Sure, you can use the assets bought in any of our value-added services. You can build maps, integrate, analyze, build a web service, and much more. Moreover, you can keep track of all your activity in a Dashboard on one place via a simple to use secure web-based application. You can check all your contracts and assets bought.
